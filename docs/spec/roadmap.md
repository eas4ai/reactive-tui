# Roadmap

Current: z-index-tests-segfault

Order agreed with the developer on 2026-09-21: charts first on a cell canvas,
then a general graphics canvas over wgpu that replaces the rasterizer
underneath, then the remaining widget families measured against gpui-kit.
The quality bar (BAR) applies to every commitment. On 2026-09-22 the
developer ruled that the SuprTUI renderer plan lands before the radial
charts, so filled shapes are drawn once on the new blitters.

## charts-plot-layer

Requirements: BAR-001, BAR-002, BAR-003, BAR-004, BAR-005, BAR-006, BAR-007, CHT-010, CHT-025, CHT-011, CHT-012, CHT-013, CHT-014, CHT-017, CHT-018, CHT-019, CHT-020, CHT-021, CHT-022, CHT-023, CHT-024, CHT-026, CHT-027, CHT-028

Deliver the shared plot layer and the cartesian charts on it: line, area,
scatter, bar (vertical and horizontal) and candlestick, with braille and eighth-block rasterization on a
worker, theme colors, the swatch-row tooltip with crosshair, mouse and
keyboard selection, value transitions, fill-parent sizing with mini, medium
and large size classes, goldens at three sizes, a catalog page and a manual section per type.

Done when every named requirement passes, each mechanism has recorded a
failing violating example before its passing receipt, the five workspace
gates pass, and the review finds no chart type mapping data outside the
plot layer.

## suprtui-renderer

Requirements: BAR-001, BAR-002, BAR-003, BAR-004, BAR-005, BAR-006, BAR-007, RAS-001, RAS-002, RAS-003, RAS-004, RAS-005, RAS-006, RAS-007, RAS-008, PNT-001, PNT-002, PNT-003, PNT-004, PIP-001, PIP-002, BLT-001, BLT-002

Deliver the SuprTUI renderer plan captured from charts-plot-layer: a
rasterizer that tracks the cursor and the last emitted style and writes
bytes without per-cell allocation, a row diff over the column arrays,
statistics and an overlay for them, replay equivalence against recorded
screens, pipelined presentation with one frame in flight and flush
failures reported, a painter fast path for untransformed nodes, a per-cell
hit grid that the event layer prefers, one element copy per present,
layout reuse for an unchanged spec, and image fallback through half-block,
quadrant, sextant, octant and braille blitters chosen by tier.

Order: rasterizer (RAS), presentation (PIP), painter and hit testing (PNT),
image fallback (BLT). Each phase lands with its mechanism recording a
failing violating example before its passing receipt; the charts goldens
and the frame-budget mechanism (BAR-005, CHT-021) stay green throughout;
every borrowed algorithm is credited in the crate's UPSTREAM.md.

Done when every named requirement passes, the manual sentence in PIP-002
is updated, and the review finds no per-cell allocation or per-cell reset
on the render path.

## suprtui

Requirements: BAR-001, BAR-002, BAR-003, BAR-004, BAR-005, BAR-006, BAR-007, RAS-001, RAS-002, RAS-003, RAS-004, RAS-005, RAS-006, RAS-007, RAS-008, PNT-001, PNT-002, PNT-003, PNT-004, PIP-001, PIP-002, BLT-001, BLT-002

Supersedes suprtui-renderer by the developer's ruling on 2026-09-23. The
developer raised RAS-005's unchanged-frame bound to 1 millisecond while
suprtui-renderer was open, and a started commitment's frozen contract is
not amended, so this commitment freezes the revised text. Its
requirements and done-when are those of suprtui-renderer, and the
rasterizer, presentation, painter and blitter work delivered under it
carries over unchanged.

Deliver the SuprTUI renderer plan already landed under suprtui-renderer:
check every requirement on the current code, record each mechanism's
review against the frozen text, and close with the commitment review.

Done when every named requirement passes, the manual sentence in PIP-002
is updated, and the review finds no per-cell allocation or per-cell reset
on the render path.

## z-index-tests-segfault

Requirements: BAR-001

Promoted from backlog item 51085de3. tests/z_index_tests.rs crashed with
SIGSEGV once in the full workspace test run on 2026-09-22 (receipt
dba7b94c) and passed every standalone rerun. The tests use only
apply_utility_classes and StyleBuilder, with no unsafe code. The host's
memory overclock, the cause of the other crashes seen then, was turned
off on 2026-09-23.

Run the z_index_tests binary in a loop beside a full workspace test run,
with backtraces and core dumps on. A crash that turns up is fixed at its
cause, with a test that reproduces it; if none turns up, the item closes
as the host's fault.

Done when every quality-bar requirement passes and the z_index_tests
binary passes 1,000 runs under that load without a signal, or a crash
found in those runs is fixed and the test that reproduces it passes.

## charts-radial-and-flow

Requirements: CHT-015, CHT-016 plus the quality bar

Pie, donut, radar and sankey on the same plot layer and braille canvas.

## graphics-canvas

Developer ruling 2026-09-21: stay on wgpu; take lessons from rust_pixel
(tile-first cell buffer, charts kept in characters) and beamterm (whole grid
as one instanced draw through a glyph atlas, sub-millisecond at 45,000
cells, overlay compositing) without adopting their GL stacks. The
commitment replaces the cube demo with a wgpu cell-grid renderer: a
CellFrame uploaded as instances against a glyph atlas in one draw, an
offscreen target sized to the widget, a worker, a 2D drawing layer for
paths, fills and gradients that rasterizes into the same target, and output
by host capability (half blocks everywhere, Kitty or Sixel pixels where the
host supports them). The keystone's "not a windowing system" stands; window
presentation of the same frame is a possible later commitment, not this
one. Requirements to be drafted when this commitment is next.

## widget-parity

Remaining widget families measured against gpui-kit 0.6.6 (docs/recon.md
section 13). Requirements to be drafted when this commitment is next.
